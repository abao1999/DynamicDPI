# DynamicDPI
Dynamic Imaging with Uncertainty Quantification. Reconstructing video of quickly evolving sources, using Deep Probabilistic Imaging (DPI) in message passing on a probabilstic graphical model of the hidden images.

## Run Examples
TODO
  
## Requirements
General requirements for PyTorch release:
* [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [torchkbnufft](https://pypi.org/project/torchkbnufft/)

For radio interferometric imaging:
* [eht-imaging](https://pypi.org/project/ehtim/)
* [astropy](https://pypi.org/project/astropy/)
* [pyNFFT](https://pypi.org/project/pyNFFT/)

Please check ```DPI.yml``` for the detailed Anaconda environment information. TensorFlow release is coming soon!
